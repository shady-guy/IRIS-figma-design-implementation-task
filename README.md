# IRIS-figma-design-implementation-task
## 1. Design Rationale:
   Mainly I tried to bring to the forefront most frequently used modules and removed those that felt redundant / not that important.
   To decide which modules to keep in the dashboard, I went over my own activity and I also consulted my peers.
   The most accessed modules according to the feedback I received: attendance and moodle.
   Another big observation I made was the dissatisfaction with the colour scheme for attendance: 90% shouldn't be in yellow, 80% shouldn't be red.
   In the earliest version of IRIS that I remember, the option to see minor CGPA and credits was there which was removed. I decided to bring that back.
   (Although I couldn't implement the functionality, I kept the buttons)
## 2. Implemented features:
   About IRIS and IRIS Blog are interactable links that take user to the respective websites.
   The moodle logo and NITK logo take user to moodle.org and nitk.ac.in when clicked on.
   Text can be entered in the search bar.
   Website is compatible for both desktop and mobile.
## 3. AI Tools used:
   I sat down with my friend who taught me how to use GitHub and the basics of Frontend.
   I had basically 0 knowledge in frontend development so I learnt it from scratch with the help of my friend.
   I started coding with the help of copilot assistant on GitHub.
   Most of the later commits are completely thru copilot help.
   The tools and frameworks I used are jsx (html in js), css (for the aesthetic), js (for the logic), vite (for deployment) and vercel (hosting site)

The frontend work is not really good ik that. It should be noted however that all this was done after cramming the knowledge in less than a day.
So, I do have an aptitude for learning. I learn quickly.
